## Synopsis
A set of sample-scripts for review by hiring managers or selection committee. These scripts are used for my day-to-day research and are not true indicators of my coding potential. Study-specific (major) tools that I developed cannot be included here as those are only for internal use.

## Python

**hpPHASDetect.v2.0.py**: Script predicts novel hairpin-PHAS class from results generated by 'phasTER' (unpublished phasing analysis tool developed by me)

**rocket.v3.3.py**: Internal version of smallRNA/longRNA pre-processing and expression profiling script using ab initio approach

**PhasRedundant.v1.05.py**: One component of 'phasTER' (unpublished phasing analysis tool developed by me) to collapse results from multiple libraries

**geneOverlap.v07.py**: Script written to check overlap and genomic context of transcripts downstram of Single Molecule Real Time Seqeuncing (SMRT-seq). It is one of the six different scripts for SMRT seq data analysis

## R

**iSyTE2.Lumi.R**: Script written for yet-unpublished iSyTE tool. Processes Illumina Microarray's data.

**iSyTE2.Affy.R**: Script written for yet-unpublished iSyTE tool. Processes Affymetrix Microarray's data.

**AGTwoColor.R**: Script processes custom-microarray (Maize) two-color data

**iSyTENet.R**: Script written for yet-unpublished iSyTE tool. Constructs co-expression based gene networks.

## NOTE
These scripts belongs to Prof. Meyers (Donald Danforth Plant Science Centre) and Dr. Lachke (University of Delaware) Lab.
