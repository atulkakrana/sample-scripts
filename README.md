## Synopsis
This repository includes a few sample scripts for review by hiring managers or selection committee. Please consider these as samples that I can share outside my group; these are just to give an idea and are not true indicator of my expertise in programming langugaes. 

Study-specific (major) tools that I developed cannot be included here as those are only for internal use. I would encourage you to review my other public repositories as well - [sPARTA](https://github.com/atulkakrana/sPARTA) and [PHASIS](https://github.com/atulkakrana/PHASIS)
