## Synopsis
A set of sample-scripts for review by hiring managers or selection committee. These scripts are used for my day-day and are not true indicator of my coding potential. Study-specific (main) tools that I developed cannot be included here as those are only for internal use.

## Python

hpPHASDetect.v2.0.py	: Script predicts novel hairpin-PHAS class from results generated by 'phasTER' (unpublished phasing analysis tool developed by me)

rocket.v3.3.py			: Internal version of smallRNA/longRNA pre-processing and expression profiling script using ab initio approach

PhasRedundant.v1.05.py	: One component of 'phasTER' (unpublished phasing analysis tool developed by me) to collapse results from multiple libraries

geneOverlap.v07.py		: Script written to check overlap and genomic context of transcripts downstram of Single Molecule Real Time Seqeuncing (SMRT-seq). It is one of the six different scripts for SMRT seq data analysis

## R

iSyTE2_LumiALL.R	: Script written for unpublished iSyTE tool. Processes Illumina Microarray's data.

iSyTE2_AF4302A_All.R: Script written for unpublished iSyTE tool. Processes Affymetrix Microarray's data.

AGTwoColor.R		: Script processes custom-microarray (Maize) two-color data

iSyTENet.R			: Script written for unpublished iSyTE tool. Generates co-expression based gene networks.

NOTE: These are scripts written for my day-to-day research, and belongs to Meyers (Donald Danforth Plant Science Centre) and Lachke (University of Delaware) Lab.
